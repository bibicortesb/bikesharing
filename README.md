## Project Overview

V. 

### Purpose

Through this project, citibike information is analized to draw insights of the behaviour of the consumers. This information intends to support the endeavour of a bike-sharing venture in Des Moins.Month of August was selected to conduct this analisis because of the warm weather for a starting point. 

Three main questions were addressed:
  - The time bikes are used for all riders and genders. 
  - The bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour and day of the week.
  - The bike trips 
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Resources

- Data Source: citibikedata.csv 
- Software: Tableau & Python 3.9.12, 

## Results

The results were published in Tableau public in the following link: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_16744307292060/bikesharing?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In the first slide, the purpose of the project is described. Followed by the visualizations that will deepen the analysis.

### Number of rides

It is important to define the universe we will focuse the analysis. In August 2019 in NYC, the total numbers of rides is presented in the dashboard as a text box, 2,344,224. 

### Checkout Times for Users

In the line graph, th number of bikes is plotted against the tripduration in minutes. By observing the graph, we can begin to draw conclusions. Trips that are 5-6 minutes long are the most recurrent trips. The peek is observed in the plot around 146k rides. Another interesting insights is that few trips last longer than 1 hour.  

### Checkout Times by Gender

In the graph the checkouts are displayed by gender. Here, we have more resolution on data which enables us to drill into the information to find that males use significantly more the bikesharing service than females. Both have their peek tripduration around 5 minutes. The peek of males is around 100k rides. On their side, females peek at 34k, this mean a difference in utilization of 66% more for males. This can also lead to further questions. Is there anything that can be done to even these numbers? Shall the initial campaing give more focus to males since their adoption is higher? Just a few observations that could support customer profiling.


###Third

The heat map shows that the behaviour changes from weekdays to weekends. Furthermore, the bussiest hours change.
On Sundays and Saturdays, the range of service utilization is more frequent from 10 am to 6 pm. On weekdays it is different, most trips are concentrated in defined periods on the moring and aternoon. On interesting day is friday, it seems to be the busiest day of the week, with a sort of merge between the behaviour of the weekends and weeekdays. 



### Forth

The heat map shows that the 
- Th bussiest hours of the day are in the morning fro 6.00am to 9.00pm
- The bussiest hour of the day are in the afternoon are from 4.00pm tp 8.00 pm.
- Weekdays also have more demand than weekends. 


### Fifth

In the heat map, the contrast between user types is well defined. Suscriber use significally more the bike sharing service. Gender diemnsion enables to have valuable information on gender, weekday and usertype behaviour. Some insights that are preseted in the heat map are the following: 
- Suscribers represent have significantly more activity than regular costumers.
- The busiets days are Thursday and Friday.
- Customers use the service on weekends more frequently than they do on weekdays.
